## What is TTL?

Time to Live (TTL) represents to number of 'hops' a packet can take before it is considered invalid.

## Why Change this value at all?

Some ISP prohibit 'tethering' your phone to another device. By changing TTL value, the carriers must think you're using the phone, not the device it's tethered to.
